# round-py: A Python client for the Gem API
The round client is designed to interact with Gem's API to make building blockchain apps drop dead simple.  All the complexity of the bitcoin protocol and crypto has been abstracted away so you can focus on building your product.  Here are a few of the many great things the API and clients provide:

* Multi-signature wallets with Gem as a cosigner
* Webhook notifications automatically subscribed for you
* Integrated 2FA solution with arbitrary endpoints to build into your app
* Simplified balance inqueries
* Easy address management
* Hardware Security Modules for co-signing key
* Rules engine for transactions
* SDKs for many popular languages

## Installing round-py:
### Prerequisites:
* Python 2.7
* Virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper (or equivalent virtual environment solution) is required for Linux and recommended for everyone.
* Git and a python extension build environment.
