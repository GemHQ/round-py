* Multi-signature wallets with Gem as a cosigner
* Webhook notifications automatically subscribed for you
* Integrated 2FA solution with arbitrary endpoints to build into your app
* Simplified balance inqueries
* Easy address management
* Hardware Security Modules for co-signing key
* Rules engine for transactions
* SDKs for many popular languages
