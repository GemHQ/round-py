        """Create a new Device object.

        Devices tie Users and Applications together. For your Application to
        access and act on behalf of a User, the User must authorize a Device
        created by your Application.

        This function will return a `device_token` which you must store and use
        after the Device is approved in
          `client.authenticate_device(api_token, device_token)`

        The second value returned is an `mfa_uri` which is the location the User
        must visit to approve the new device. After this function completes,
        you should launch a new browser tab or webview with this value as the
        location. After the User approves the Device, they will be redirected to
        the redirect_uri you specify in this call.

        Args:
          name (str): Human-readable name for the device
            (e.g. "Suzanne's iPhone")
          redirect_uri (str, optional): A URI to which to redirect the User after
            they approve the new Device.

        Returns: A tuple of (device_token, mfa_uri)
        """
