    You may choose to store the passphrase for a user so the user doesn't have
    to type it in every time. This is okay (although the security risks should be
    obvious) but Gem strongly discourages storing even the encrypted private
    seed, and storing both the passphrase and the private seed is completely
    insane. Don't do it.

    Args:
      passphrase (str): The passphrase that will be used to encrypt the seed
        before it's send to Gem. Key-stretching is done with PBDKF2 and
        encryption is done with nacl's SecretBox.
      network (str): Bitcoin network (bitcoin, testnet3)
      trees (list of str): A list of names to generate trees for. For User
        Wallets this will be ['primary'], for Application Wallets it will be
